# **Introduction**
### **Overview**
Goku Miner is a blockchain-powered, gamified retail engagement platform that allows users to earn digital rewards by spending time in physical retail locations. By bridging the gap between digital incentives and real-world commerce, Goku Miner transforms foot traffic into tangible value for both consumers and businesses.

### **The Inspiration**
The idea for Goku Miner was born from a personal experience in a hostel in Dubai, where I witnessed individuals struggling to afford basic necessities. Seeing this, I envisioned a system where people could earn value simply by being presentâ€”a solution that benefits both consumers and businesses.

### **Mission Statement**
Our mission is to empower individuals by turning their time into value while helping businesses increase engagement, improve retention, and enhance the shopping experience through blockchain and gamification.
